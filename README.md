üí¨ Quote of the Day: "Do you want to achieve something or do you just want to make money? Asked a nearby man in a white shirt to another man in a striped shirt. I waited for the answer as I slowly walked past them. Why is it an either or question? The man in the striped shirt finally murmured philosophically under a sip of beer. They both stood there looking at each other in thought."
