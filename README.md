üí¨ Quote of the Day: "I have this theory about performers who last for a long time, and that is, if you break it down, music is not as big a part of it as personality and who you are. I think that we are all 3 people. I am who I think I am, I am who you think I am, and I am who I really am. The closer those 3 people are together the longer your career's gonna last. 'Cause people don't like to be fooled!"
